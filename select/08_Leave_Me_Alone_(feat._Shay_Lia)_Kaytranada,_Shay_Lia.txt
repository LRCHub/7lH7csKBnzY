Can't deny or lie
Boy, you blew my mind

But I'm tired of my heart being broken
And my love being taken for granted
I gave you all I had
So crazy, how you wasted my time
How you reached the borderline

Leave me alone
Go away, leave me alone
Leave me alone
Go away, leave me alone
Leave me alone
Go away, leave me alone
Leave me alone
Go away, leave me alone

Leave me alone
Go away, leave me alone
There was a time I used to say "boy, I want you"
Leave me alone
Go away, leave me alone

Leave me alone
Go away, leave me alone
And there was a time I used to say "boy, I need you"
Leave me alone
Go away, leave me alone
Sorry, baby, no time for this

Leave me alone
Go away, leave me alone
Leave me alone
Go away, leave me alone
Leave me alone
Go away, leave me alone
Leave me alone
Go away, leave me alone

There was a time I used to say "boy, I want you"

And there was a time I used to say "boy, I need you"
Sorry, baby, no time for this

So crazy, how you wasted my time
How you reached the border, how you
How you reached the borderline
