[00:15.82] Can't deny or lie
[00:23.72] Boy, you blew my mind
[00:34.22] 
[00:31.53] But I'm tired of my heart being broken
[00:34.68] And my love being taken for granted
[00:39.93] I gave you all I had
[00:42.20] So crazy, how you wasted my time
[00:46.22] How you reached the borderline
[01:01.22] 
[00:49.03] Leave me alone
[00:50.18] Go away, leave me alone
[00:56.87] Leave me alone
[00:58.35] Go away, leave me alone
[01:04.90] Leave me alone
[01:06.53] Go away, leave me alone
[01:12.77] Leave me alone
[01:14.06] Go away, leave me alone
[01:25.56] 
[01:37.05] Leave me alone
[01:38.33] Go away, leave me alone
[01:39.95] There was a time I used to say, "Boy, I want you"
[01:44.94] Leave me alone
[01:46.20] Go away, leave me alone
[01:57.70] 
[01:53.26] Leave me alone
[01:54.27] Go away, leave me alone
[01:55.71] And there was a time I used to say, "Boy, I need you"
[02:00.98] Leave me alone
[02:02.25] Go away, leave me alone
[02:05.81] Sorry, baby, no time for this
[02:20.31] 
[02:08.53] Leave me alone
[02:10.11] Go away, leave me alone
[02:17.07] Leave me alone
[02:18.39] Go away, leave me alone
[02:24.89] Leave me alone
[02:26.19] Go away, leave me alone
[02:32.93] Leave me alone
[02:34.23] Go away, leave me alone
[02:45.73] 
[03:31.78] There was a time I used to say, "Boy, I want you"
[03:56.28] 
[03:47.55] And there was a time I used to say, "Boy, I need you"
[04:14.05] 
[03:57.94] Sorry, baby, no time for this
[04:12.44] 
[04:02.00] So crazy, how you wasted my time
[04:08.19] How you reached the border, how you
[04:12.22] How you reached the borderline
[04:27.22] 
[04:15.78] Producer, beat maker, now?
[04:17.36] I'd say, at the moment, erm, probably KAYTRANADA
[04:19.63] I think he's-he's on that exact sort of thing that we like, you know
[04:23.52] The musicality meeting the beats, erm, you know
[04:26.22] From the chords and the basslines and, erm, the rhythms
[04:29.39] Er, the-, you know, and I mean, you probably agree, he's-, he's-
[04:32.57] Yeah, shout to KAYTRANADA
[04:35.86] That whole Montreal scene
